### Student at 42 Paris, in the middle of the [common core](https://github.com/titouanck/42-cursus).

ðŸ’»  Since starting at 42, I've had the opportunity to work on a variety of programming projects that have helped me develop my computer science skills, particularly in C, such as:

- [`Minishell`](https://github.com/titouanck/42-Minishell) â†’ Built a program that replicates the functionality of the Bash shell, providing a command-line interface for system interaction.

- [`Philosophers`](https://github.com/titouanck/42-Philosophers) â†’ Implementing a solution through the Dining Philosophers problem, to avoid deadlocks in a multi-threading situation.

- [`FdF`](https://github.com/titouanck/42-FdF) â†’ Developed a program to create a wireframe representation of a 3D landscape.

- [`push_swap`](https://github.com/titouanck/42-push_swap) â†’ Created a sorting algorithm program using various sorting techniques to order stacks of integers.


Overall, I'm really enjoying my experience at 42 :)

In the near future, I would like to improve my web development skills with the aim of offering my web development services by the end of the year.
